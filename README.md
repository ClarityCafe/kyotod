# kyotod

kyotod is a implementation of the LXD Daemon that runs on a virtualization backend rather than a cgroups and namespace backend.
kyotod aims to be feature-parity of LXD, we just change the runtime the RootFSes run to. 

## So what works?

(TBD)

## Why kyotod?

We could've named it as LXVD or something else but it started development at the same time Kyoto Animation was on fire and so 
it goes.

## Building and Running 

(TBD)
